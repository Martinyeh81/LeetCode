Here, m is the length of word1 and n is the length of word2.

Time complexity: O(m+n)

We iterate over word1 and word2 once pushing their letters into result. It would take O(m+n) time.
Space complexity: O(1)

Without considering the space consumed by the input strings (word1 and word2) and the output string (result), we do not use more than constant space.
